# Adaptive Round Robin Traffic Control

A Python simulation of traffic signal management using an adaptive round robin scheduling algorithm.

## Overview

This project simulates a four-way traffic intersection and uses an adaptive round robin algorithm to manage the flow of cars. Each lane has a dynamic time quantum that adjusts based on the current traffic load, making the scheduling more efficient than fixed round robin. The simulation also models random incoming traffic using a normal distribution.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
